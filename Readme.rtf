I run Kirkland's code on my MacBook Pro. For anyone trying to do the same, or on any OSx platform, don't try to use computem. Just use the temsim programs which you use in terminal with command lines. You'll need to download the source folder from his GitHub or SourceForge and then go to the temsim folder. There you'll find makefile.osx which will compile all the C++ code into executables. The problem is that makefile.osx is not updated to the most recent versions of MacPorts GCC and also you may encounter issues with Clang if you have it installed like I did. The makefile I have in this repository worked for me.

You'll need to have home-brew installed and use that to install fftw and libomp. Then check the home-brew paths for them and replace FFTW_DIR and OMP_DIR with where your fftw and libomp are stored. Another issue may be the built-in rules which cause the makefile to not link the required libraries when compiling atompot.cpp.
